# svg2desmos
a "bare-minimum" svg to desmos graph converter that i wrote to complete my geometry project because i'm lazy

this will not work on anything that's not a very simple hand-written svg without a lot of simplification of the svg

no support is provided for this. do whatever you want (use, fork, etc)

i don't even know if this is the build that actually works or not either
